Algorithm Challenge #7 – Reverse a Number (Digit Reversal)
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive integer from the user and constructs a new number that represents the reverse of the original input.

This challenge helps strengthen understanding of digit extraction, arithmetic manipulation, and number reconstruction in C++.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
How to extract digits using modulo and integer division

How to rebuild a number digit-by-digit

Working with loops for iterative digit processing

Avoiding string-based reversal by using pure arithmetic

Enhancing algorithmic and logical thinking

🧩 Example
-
Input:

Please enter a positive number: 1234

Output:

Reversed Number: 4321

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: reverse_number.cpp

Challenge Number: #7

💬 Notes
-
This algorithm is essential for understanding number manipulation using arithmetic only—no arrays, strings, or STL functions required.
It’s a common problem in programming interviews and competitive programming.
